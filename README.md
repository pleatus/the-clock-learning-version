# the-clock-learning-version
This clock was created on a whim. Decided it was time to give time a refresh. A running (real-time) version is viewable on my website.
Eventually I'll get around to finishing this educational version. I'd like to make it a quiz/test where a visitor can select how many clocks they would like to guess the time for (15,25,50?). It will take them through the test and record the results into a relational database to be visualized later; to improve and iterate over the clock and it's readability/ease of understanding.
